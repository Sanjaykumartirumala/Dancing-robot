The robot stays perfectly still by default.

When you move your cursor over the robot, the .stage:hover selector triggers CSS animations.

Arms, legs, and body all start moving in sync (dancing).

As soon as you move the cursor away, all animations stop instantly (CSS stops animations when hover ends).
